# TV-Script-Generation

This repo is a project submission for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program. The goal of the project is to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate a Simpsons TV script. (It was trained on a small dataset, so the results aren't very sensible)


See [this notebook](/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb) for the details.
